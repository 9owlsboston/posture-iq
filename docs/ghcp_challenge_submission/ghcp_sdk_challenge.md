# GitHub Copilot SDK Enterprise Challenge

**Feb 9 – Mar 7** — Showcase customer-oriented, enterprise grade MVPs built with the GitHub Copilot SDK

---

## Why now?

Copilot started as an "in-the-IDE" assistant that helps to write code faster → the SDK lets customers embed the same agentic core that powers Copilot CLI into their own apps.

We're kicking off a three-week challenge to build and showcase the most compelling, production-ready solutions for the enterprise.
